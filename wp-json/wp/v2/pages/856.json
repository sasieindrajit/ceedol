PAYMENT<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.1 Payment shall be made in United States Dollars (or any equivalent currency as the Seller may require) by bank transfer to the Seller\u2019s bank account, net of all banking charges in accordance with the Contract as specified in the invoice. Payment shall be deemed to have been made on the date the payment is credited to the Seller\u2019s bank account. Payment to any other bank account shall not release the Buyer from its payment obligations.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.2 The Seller shall issue its invoice for the Purchase Price and shall provide a copy of the BDN, but the Buyer\u2019s liability shall not be contingent upon an invoice being issued or the BDN being supplied.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.3 It is the Buyer\u2019s risk and responsibility to ensure that the Seller\u2019s bank details are bona fides. Where payment is being made to an account for the first time the Buyer must check the bank details with the Seller by secure means (ie. By telephone, encrypted messaging or in person). The Seller shall be entitled to allocate payments from the Buyer at its sole discretion and regardless of any allocation stipulated by the Buyer and shall be entitled to extinguish claims for compensation, interest, legal fees or any other sums due from the Buyer in priority to invoices for Marine Fuel and regardless of the date that respective obligations arose.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.4 Where payment is delayed in part or in full the Buyer shall pay to the Seller interest at the rate of 3% per month or part thereof on the delayed sum due until payment is received. In the event that the interest rate herein exceeds that permitted by any applicable Law, it shall be substituted by the maximum rate so permitted. The Buyer understands that the Seller does not provide extended finance, and the interest provisions herein reflect the costs to the Seller of unauthorized credit.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.5 Payment shall be made in full without any discount or deduction, and there shall be no withholding either in part or in full by reason of any set-off, counter-claim or for any other reason, whether relating to the Contract or past agreements or Contracts. If payment is withheld or set off by the Buyer, partly or in full, due to alleged short delivery, quality dispute or any other reason whatsoever or if any sum due pursuant to any Contract is not paid within the agreed time, the Buyer shall pay, in addition to the outstanding amount and any interest that accrues until the due date, compensation to the Seller of 20% of the outstanding amount. The Buyer recognizes that such compensation is a reasonable pre-estimate of the Seller\u2019s loss, taking account of factors including but not limited to the additional management time incurred in dealing with the late payment, the loss of opportunity to reinvest the missing funds and currency exchange fluctuations.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.6 Where credit is granted such that payment is deferred beyond the period stated in the preceding clause such credit is entirely discretionary and the Seller shall at all times be entitled to withdraw credit and demand immediate payment by giving written notice without providing reasons. For example, but without limitation, credit may be withdrawn if the Seller has reason to believe that the Buyer\u2019s (or companies related to the Buyer\u2019s) financial circumstances have deteriorated or the Seller receives information that causes it to alter its assessment of the credit risk. Where credit is withdrawn prior to delivery of Marine Fuel then the Seller shall be entitled to withhold delivery until payment of the Purchase Price is made or alternatively the Seller may cancel the order, without recourse by the Buyer.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.7 Where payment of any invoice is delayed beyond the due date any Buyer who has the right to bring a claim against any other party in relation to the Marine Fuels that are the subject of any Contract, such claim shall be automatically assigned to the Seller as at the date of the Seller\u2019s written notice that the Seller has elected to take that assignment. A Buyer in receipt of the Seller\u2019s notice consents to be named as claimant\/plaintiff or co-claimant-co-plaintiff. Where the Seller receives payment as a result of the assigned claim such proceeds shall be set against any sum owing to the Seller by the Buyer, including any claims for interest, compensation or legal costs and where the sum received exceeds the sum owed by the Buyer then the balance shall be paid to the Buyer. The Buyer shall provide full cooperation to the Seller by way of witness evidence and documentation to enable the Seller to pursue the assigned claim.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.8 If the Seller incurs any costs in relation to attempts to collect any sums due from the Buyer and arising out of any Contract the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller for such costs and shall pay the same upon first demand. Such costs include but not limited to attestation and translation costs, fees of third-party debt collection agencies, lawyer\u2019s fees, court fees and deposits and communication\/postal costs and including costs arising from the arrest, detention or seizure of any Vessel or other assets of the Buyer.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.9 Seller may from time to time without the need for prior consent of Buyer, assign any of its rights under the Contract to any third party and the assignee shall enjoy and be entitled to exercise against Buyer any and all rights herein conferred upon Seller.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.10 If at any time an amount is payable by Buyer to Seller, such amount may at the sole discretion of Seller be fully or partially paid by set-off against any amounts payable to Buyer by Seller and any Affiliate of Seller.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9.11 The Buyer shall provide the Seller with no less than seven (7) days prior notice in writing before making payment from an account belonging to a party that is not the Buyer. Under such circumstances, for verification purposes, the Seller shall require the Buyer to provide details and relevant supporting documentation on the payor\u2019s full name, country of incorporation, registered address, line of business, relationship with the Buyer, and the reason why payment is being made on behalf of the Buyer. In the event that the Seller is unable to verify the payment and\/or payor to its satisfaction, the Seller shall be entitled in its discretion to reject such payment and require the Buyer to make another payment from another duly verified account and\/or payor.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>10.

In the event of such termination of the Contract, the Seller shall be relieved of its obligations to perform hereunder. 10.4 The Buyer shall have no right of cancellation of the Contract due to Force Majeure as stated in clause 10.1.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>11.

The Buyer, if not the owner of the Vessel, hereby expressly warrants that he has the authority of the owner to pledge the Vessel\u2019s credit as aforesaid and that he has given clear notice of the provisions of this clause to the owner.
